As the world steps into 2021, December 2020, will go on to live forever in the history books as the month when the USA and in a way the whole world suffered a cyber attack that the experts are calling “the hack of the decade”. 

In a state-sponsored cyberattack that has been reported to be linked with domestic and international Russian intelligence agencies, multiple sectors of US Governments have been compromised. Critical sectors including energy, commerce, US Homeland Security, treasury, nuclear weapons arsenal, and multiple federal agencies were compromised. However, the level of damage and the extent of the potential implications are still unclear.

**Details of the hack so far**


It all began when hackers successfully managed to hide and inject their malicious code into the product updates of a network management suite named Orion, developed by a cybersecurity company SolarWinds. The Orion suite is one of the best network management software that is being used by hundreds of thousands of small to large businesses and established organizations including fortune 500 companies all over the globe. Injecting the malicious code into the product updates allowed hackers to gain remote access to the critical networks of the organizations and US federal institutes having operations in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Apparently, the adversaries gained access to the networks of US departments along with hundreds of organizations a few months before the attack was discovered and was able to steal an ample amount of data during this period of time.
According to Microsoft, it was “an attack that is remarkable for its scope, sophistication, and impact”.


**The potential impact of the hack**


The hack in itself was so massive and sophisticated that it is still unclear that how much data has been stolen and what fraudsters can do with it. Around 18000 organizations using Solarwind’s Orion suite throughout the globe downloaded the malicious software update as a routine procedure and got breached. And the experts including the tech giant firms like FireEye and Microsoft are still investigating the causes and effects of the attack. 

According to Microsoft, the cyber attack also impacted 40 of its clients, while Microsoft was not even the prime target of the attack. The attack affected government agencies, NGOs, hundreds of colleges and universities non-governmental organisations, and IT companies. About 80% of these were in the US, while others were in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Israel, and the UAE.

Many federal authorities and cybersecurity firms are still struggling to understand the level of impact the attack will pose in the coming future and the level of data that has been stolen from all these critical governmental departments and other key companies and institutions. An overview of the hack includes the compromise of the US state department, the treasury department, homeland security, the Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories (where nuclear weapons are developed), the National Nuclear Security Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and many more.  

“This hack was so big in scope that even our cybersecurity experts don’t have a real sense yet in the terms of the breadth of the intrusion itself,” Stephen Lynch, head of the House of Representatives oversight committee, said after attending a classified briefing on Friday.

Thomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins cyber-conflict expert, told the APN News it was likely the hackers had harvested such a vast quantity of data that “they themselves most likely don’t know yet” what useful information they’ve stolen.


**Russia’s role in the hack** 


It has been reported and believed that the attack was the doing of the Russian Government. And was carried out by the Russian foreign intelligence institution with close collaboration with SVR and FSB that are Russian intelligence agencies once led by none other than the Russian President Vladimir Putin.  However, Russia naturally has denied all the involvement and allegations. “One shouldn’t unfoundedly blame the Russians for everything,” a Kremlin spokesman said. 
While the Russian embassy in the US said it "does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber domain".
"Malicious activities in the information space contradict the principles of the Russian foreign policy, national interests, and our understanding of interstate relations," the embassy said.

Regarding the recovery and costs below are the comments offered 
“It will take years to know for certain which networks the Russians control and which ones they just occupy. The logical conclusion is that we must act as if the Russian government has control of all the networks it has penetrated. A ‘do-over’ is mandatory and entire new networks need to be built – and isolated from compromised networks.” Bossert wrote in the New York Times.
