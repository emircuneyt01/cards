At 3rd January of 2021, the year started with some scam attempts.
As you can remember from the Twitter hacking, where hackers shared posts from famous accounts like Bill Gates, Elon Musk etc, similar one just occured on Twitch.tv.

Scammers, using their twitch account and probably with some bots in chat, tried the same tecnhique used on twitter.
To my understanding, they were used a pre-recorded live Q&A stream from Elon Musk and some other SpaceX engineers.
Scammers used nickname called "elon_musk1411" where you can find (not anymore) here: "https://www.twitch.tv/elon_musk1411".


Basically, the scam goes like, if you send 1 BTC to so called "Elon Musk", they will send you 2 BTC's back.

I catch the live stream for four minutes and managed to get a screenshot but not a clip or video.
And then, `Twtich` immediately banned the channel, but for now we don't have access to anyone who got scammed or not.

We will continue to search about if any people got scammed.
